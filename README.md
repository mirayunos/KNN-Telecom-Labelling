# KNN-Telecom-Labelling
Predicting telecommunication services selected by the customers with K-Nearest-Neighbour Algorithm. Special thanks to Dr. Mohammed Al-Obaydee for the guidance.

The main goal is to predict which of the services will be selected by the customers:

1- Basic Service 2- E-Service 3- Plus Service 4- Total Service

The accuracy of the model is low (~30%) however, more works needed on the data preparation.
